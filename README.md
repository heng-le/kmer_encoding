# Generalized Bloom Filters

This project implements a memory-efficient and generalized Bloom Filter for tracking k-mers and their positions in a genome. The design supports partitioning the bit array into multiple hash functions to improve scalability and retrieval performance, making it suitable for large-scale genomic and sequence alignment tasks.
